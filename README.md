Description: A project to research the impact of patch size on the performance of breast tumor segmentation on mammography images, experimental testing techniques, and testing the elimination of skip connections on UNet backbone EfficientNetB0

Achievement: The results when segmenting on patches show better results than when segmenting on the entire image
